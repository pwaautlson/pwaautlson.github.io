<br>    “Aedh Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven” by William Butler Yeats
 <br><br>
    Had I the heavens’ embroidered cloths,
Enwrought with golden and silver light,
The blue and the dim and the dark cloths
Of night and light and the half light,
I would spread the cloths under your feet:
But I, being poor, have only my dreams;
I have spread my dreams under your feet;
Tread softly because you tread on my dreams

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeats was an Irish poet who won the Nobel Prize for
Literature. This poem is from the period when he wrote
primarily about mythology and Irish legend. Aedh, the god
of death in Irish mythology, was one of four characters
who appear in Yeats’s poetry in the middle of his writing
career. A love poem often abbreviated “The Cloths of
Heaven,” this work of Yeats explores the idea of wanting
to give gifts to someone you love, but having only the
greatest gift of all, your dreams, to give. The poem also
explores the idea that love makes you vulnerable because
the person you love could hurt you by treading harshly on
your dreams.

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About me: I am currently a junior at Eastern Washington University. I am majoring in BFA-VCD-ST with a minor in Web Design. My current GPA is 3.76. I am interested in web/graphic design because it is something I enjoy and have a aptitude for. I am a certified martial-arts instructor with over 25 years of experience ranging from personal, private, and corporate. I obtained my first Black Belt from Paul Graystone, an  9th degree black belt, and then with Royce Gracie an 8th degree black belt; both in Jujitsu. I studied Eskrima, and Kali in the Philippines over three years, and own a consulting company.
