    (I really loved the background video on this site.)

  <li><a href="http://hoovermason.com/#/">Site Two</a> (I seem to find video backgrounds Interesting but distracting.  )

  <li><a href="http://universewithin.nfb.ca/desktop.html#index">Site Three</a>
    (I love this background too. It seems to be a movie, but reacts to my mouse) NOPE, it got me sick. Donâ€™t like it now. Don't go to it.
    <br></li>
<li><a href="http://www.kennedyandoswald.com/#!/premiere-screen">Site Four</a>
    (This one can scroll with my touch-screen, and mouse. Holy crap! I love the interface, picture mixing thing, and the design of this site. )
    <br></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.google.com/">Site Five</a>
    (This is Google.com, I thought this is simple, and like it for this reason. Please see question Four. )

  <li><a href="http://jwt.amsterdam/en/home">Site one</a> / <a href="http://hoovermason.com/#/">Site Two</a>
    (On site one and two, the background seems to be really artistically interesting, but distracting as a user. 
      <br>
      Question one: Do the move backgrounds have a load time cost, and or User navigation cost?    ) <br>
    Question two: on sit one the coding seems to be what we use <a href="view-source:http://jwt.amsterdam/en/home">( Seen Here )</a>, But on site two; it seems to be some funky code only using 13 lines <a href="view-source:http://hoovermason.com/#/">( Seen Here ).</a>
    <br>
      Question three: What is the difference between the two types of coding? 
      </li>
    
    <li>
    Question four: When looking at Google's page I can see eight things on a white background. My question is this; Why is there 259 lines of code for eight things on their page? P.S That same type of crazy coding found on site two seems too be used on site five.  <a href="view-source:https://www.google.com/">Site five code</a> 
<li>Is the weird code java, or Phpp you stated in class? </li>      
 <li>Last question: Why is my font bigger using the same H1 TAG? 
     <br> 
     It is driving me crazy, and hours of my life trying to fix it.
