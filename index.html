  <li><a href="http://jwt.amsterdam/en/home">Site one</a>
    (I really loved the background video on this site.)
    <br>
    </li>
  <li><a href="http://hoovermason.com/#/">Site Two</a> (I seem to find video backgrounds Interesting but distracting.  )
        <br>
        </li>
    
  <li><a href="http://universewithin.nfb.ca/desktop.html#index">Site Three</a>
    (I love this background too. It seems to be a movie, but reacts to my mouse) NOPE, it got me sick. Donâ€™t like it now. Don't go to it.
    <br></li>
<li><a href="http://www.kennedyandoswald.com/#!/premiere-screen">Site Four</a>
    (This one can scroll with my touch-screen, and mouse. Holy crap! I love the interface, picture mixing thing, and the design of this site. )
    <br></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.google.com/">Site Five</a>
    (This is Google.com, I thought this is simple, and like it for this reason. Please see question Four. )
