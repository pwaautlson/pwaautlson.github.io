<br>    “Aedh Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven” by William Butler Yeats
 <br><br>
    Had I the heavens’ embroidered cloths,
Enwrought with golden and silver light,
The blue and the dim and the dark cloths
Of night and light and the half light,
I would spread the cloths under your feet:
But I, being poor, have only my dreams;
I have spread my dreams under your feet;
Tread softly because you tread on my dreams

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeats was an Irish poet who won the Nobel Prize for
Literature. This poem is from the period when he wrote
primarily about mythology and Irish legend. Aedh, the god
of death in Irish mythology, was one of four characters
who appear in Yeats’s poetry in the middle of his writing
career. A love poem often abbreviated “The Cloths of
Heaven,” this work of Yeats explores the idea of wanting
to give gifts to someone you love, but having only the
greatest gift of all, your dreams, to give. The poem also
explores the idea that love makes you vulnerable because
the person you love could hurt you by treading harshly on
your dreams.

    (I love this background too. It seems to be a movie, but reacts to my mouse) NOPE, it got me sick. Don’t like it now. Don't go to it.

  <li><a href="http://jwt.amsterdam/en/home">Site one</a> / <a href="http://hoovermason.com/#/">Site Two</a>
    (On site one and two, the background seems to be really artistically interesting, but distracting as a user. Do the move backgrounds have a load time cost, and or User navigation cost?) on sit one the coding seems to be what we use <a href="view-source:http://jwt.amsterdam/en/home">( Seen Here )</a>, But on site two; it seems to be some funky code only using 13 lines <a href="view-source:http://hoovermason.com/#/">( Seen Here ). </a> What is the difference between the two types of coding?
             </li>
                <br>
  <li>When looking at Google's page I can see eight things on a white background. My question is this; Why is there 259 lines of code for eight things on their page? P.S That same type of crazy coding found on site two seems too be used on site five.  <a href="view-source:https://www.google.com/">Site five code</a>
 Is the weird code java, or Php you stated in class?
