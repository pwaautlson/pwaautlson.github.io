          Caribbean Island Getaway is our favorite family destination <br>because my daughter was born there and still feels deep <br>connection to it. This getaway is surprisingly family-friendly <br>with world-class theme parks, amazing food and plenty of <br>opportunities to explore the outdoors via hikes, UNESCO <br>sites, beaches and excursions to outlying islands.<br><br>Our family recommends Nature Fun Excursions, and the<br> Caribbean Island Getaway.

This getaway was<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the greatest thing ever. The first night Merry went out to dinner<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and came back with Tim. Tim and his two brothers where also <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vactioning through Nature Fun Excursions. At the end of the trip<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we all decided to get married!<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can not believe it, married. All of use at the same time!<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best vacation EVER!!!</div>
